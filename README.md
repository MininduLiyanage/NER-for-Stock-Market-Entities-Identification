# NER-for-Stock-Market-Entities-Identification

In this repository, I've implemented Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Spacy tailored for financial texts, particularly focusing on the stock exchange market. 

The model leverages Spacy's Entity Ruler method to identify entities such as companies, stock-related prefixes, indexes, and codes. Starting with a blank "en" model from Spacy, I integrated a customized entity ruler to enhance its ability to recognize these specific entities in financial texts.
